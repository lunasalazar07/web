            <h3>
                Cyber attacks are becoming increasingly common. Here are five common types of attacks that an organisation needs to guard against. <br>
                PHISHING: With phishing, an attacker poses as a trusted <br> individual to obtain sensitive <information class="br"></information>
                MALWARE: Malware is code designed to infect, <br> destroy or take control of a computer. <br>
                SOL INJECTION: An SQL injection is a type of web attack where <br> code is inserted to access private, back-end data. <br>
                DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACK: DoS attacks look to overload a system with traffic or <br> data so it is inaccessible to legitimate users. <br>
                MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE (MITM) ATTACK: An MITM attack is one where the hacker can unknowingly <br> intercept and modify communication between two parties. <br>

            <h3>
                BAD PASSWORD PRACTICE
                Use private, certificate-based authentication, or passwords <br> which are changed at least every 60 days and have combinations of letters, <br> numbers and symbols. Storing these in a secure password manager <br> or keychain can help you remember them. <br>
                NOT BACKING UP CORRECTLY (OR AT ALL) <br>
                There is a tendency to 'setup and forget', so they don't <br> realise something has failed with the system until it's too late. <br> It is recommended that companies perform daily offsite backups <br> of their systems, as well as periodically validate <br> the quality of the backups. <br>
                POOR ACCESS CONTROLS <br>
                Investing in privileged access management (PAM) software, <br> a solution that helps organizations restrict privileged access within <br> an existing Active Directory environment, is a wise move. <br> Large-scale incidents are likely to involve unauthorized administrative <br> or root access to critical systems.
